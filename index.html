						<h2>Advanced Satellite Imaging System Optimization Project</h2>
						<p>This innovative project revolutionizes satellite operations 
							by employing a rapid reinforcement learning-based mission 
							planning algorithm, coupled with a compact, AI-driven image 
							quality assessment model, enabling instantaneous optimization 
							of image capture costs and efficient use of satellite storage space.</p>
						<div id="project1-details" class="hidden">
							<h3>Mission Planning Optimization:</h3>
							<p>In the realm of satellite imagery, the process of planning missions 
								to capture specific images involves intricate combinatorial mathematics. 
								Traditionally, the task is time-consuming due to numerous variables. 
								To expedite this process without compromising total costs, 
								I implemented a reinforcement learning algorithm. 
								This algorithm significantly reduced mission planning time compared 
								to traditional mathematical models, resulting in slightly lower costs. 
								The key advantage lies in the ability to dynamically update the satellite's 
								mission plan instantaneously when it passes under a ground station antenna, 
								allowing for real-time adjustments based on already captured images.</p>
							<h3>AI Image Quality Assessment Model:</h3>
							<p>Addressing the challenge of distinguishing usable images from those 
								affected by factors such as cloud cover, 
								a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was developed. 
								The CNN acts as an artificial intelligence (AI) model capable of 
								assessing image quality before storage, preventing the 
								unnecessary occupation of limited satellite storage space.</p>
							<h3>Model Deployment Strategies:</h3>
							<p>Embedding AI models into satellites poses challenges due to limited storage
								 capacity. Three strategies were employed for efficient model integration:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Quantification:</strong> Optimizing storage by reducing the precision of model weights.</li>
								<li><strong>Weight Pruning:</strong> Drastically reducing network size by removing connections, neurons, or layers with the smallest weights.</li>
								<img src="images/project/Satellite/weight_pruning.jpg" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
								<li><strong>Distillation:</strong> Employing knowledge transfer techniques to distill the essence of a complex model into a smaller, more efficient form.</li>
								<img src="images/project/Satellite/distillation.jpg" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
							</ul>
							<p>The chosen solution involved a combination of all three methods, achieving a substantial reduction in storage space while maintaining accurate image quality assessments.</p>
							<h3>Project Impact:</h3>
							<p>In summary, the project enables the instantaneous creation of a mission plan
								 optimizing the overall cost of satellite image captures. 
								 The incorporation of a CNN allows the satellite to store only usable images, 
								 maximizing storage efficiency. Additionally, the ability to provide the satellite 
								 with an updated mission plan in real-time upon data transfer to a ground station 
								 enhances operational flexibility and responsiveness.</p>

						<h2>Precision Landing Time Prediction for Aircraft</h1>
						<p>Predict the landing time of an aircraft
							from a certain distance from the airport using
							meteorological data, flight data, airport data through
							machine learning and deep learning models.</p>
						<div id="project2-details" class="hidden">
							<p>At Navblue, a subsidiary of Airbus, 
								I spearheaded a project focused on revolutionizing aircraft 
								landing time predictions. This endeavor involved a meticulous 
								integration of meteorological, flight, and airport data through 
								a combination of machine learning and deep learning models.</p>
							<h3>Data Retrieval and Composition:</h3>
							<p>The datasets were diverse and intricate. 
								For flight data, we delved into specifics such as historical 
								landing times, aircraft type, and previous delays. Airport data 
								encompassed details about the proximity of landing strips, airport 
								congestion patterns, and historical performance. Meteorological data 
								included parameters like wind speed, visibility, and atmospheric pressure. 
								Merging these datasets formed a comprehensive foundation for our predictive models.</p>
							<h3>Preprocessing Steps:</h3>
							<p>Ensuring data quality was paramount. 
								We performed rigorous preprocessing to handle missing values, 
								outliers, and inconsistencies. For flight data, we engineered 
								features like time of day, day of the week, and holiday indicators 
								to capture temporal patterns. Airport data underwent geospatial analysis 
								to quantify the distance of landing strips from the aircraft's current position. 
								Meteorological data required normalization and temporal alignment to synchronize 
								with flight timelines.</p>
							<h3>Machine Learning Model - XGBoost:</h3>
							<p>In the initial stages, we applied machine learning techniques, 
								including the robust XGBoost algorithm. Feature importance 
								analysis guided us in understanding the contributions of 
								different parameters. While effective, XGBoost faced challenges, 
								especially in accurately predicting high delays.</p>
							<h3>Deep Learning Models - Neural Network:</h3>
							<p>Transitioning to deep learning, a neural network architecture 
								was developed to capture complex relationships within the data. 
								This model exhibited improvement over XGBoost, particularly in 
								handling scenarios with increased delays.</p>
							<h3>Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Implementation:</h3>
							<p>Recognizing the temporal nature of flight data,
								 we explored LSTM networks. The sequence-to-sequence 
								 learning capability of LSTMs allowed us to model the 
								 changing positions of aircraft over time, significantly 
								 enhancing our ability to predict delays accurately.</p>
							<h3>AWS Deployment and Scalability:</h3>
							<p>Upon meticulous validation, the LSTM model was deployed on 
								Amazon Web Services (AWS). This cloud-based deployment ensured 
								scalability, enabling real-time predictions and adaptability to 
								varying operational demands.

								This comprehensive approach not only enhanced the accuracy of landing time predictions but also laid the foundation for a more resilient and adaptable system for Navblue.</p>
